# number_guesser

This is a mini python project where user can put a max value on their choice and try to guess it. 
They will also get a feedback whether their guess was bigger or smaller than the actual number which generated randomly.
When they get it wrong, they get to try again;
When they get it right, they get a confirmation message along with the information about number of guesses.
